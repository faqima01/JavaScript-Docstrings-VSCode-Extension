# JavaScript Docstrings

## Features

This extension will save you time and make your code well-documented. Using this extension, you will be able to document your functions, classes, variables, header, etc, in the most efficient way. Look at the quick demo here:

* Class
* Function
* Generator function

* Header
* Author
* Version

* Deprecated items
* Read-Only item
* this Keyword
* To-do
* Data types notations
* Link

## How It Works

Nothing special. Just install it and go to your Command Palette. There, search for JSDocs. Then, you will see a bunch of options like JSDocs: Function. Make sure your cursor or selection is on the line where you would like the documentation to be inserted on the line above that. That could be function's head in the case of function, just as demonstrated above.

## Known Issues

Make sure your cursor is not on the first line, as the documentation is to be inserted on the line before that.
